#Visualization of Dataset using Tableau

This repository contains images related to my Tableau visualization project.
#Description

For this data visualization project I have used TABLEAU PUBLIC to visualize, for that I have downloaded a random dataset called SOCIAL MEDIA SENTIMENTS ANALYSIS from KAGGLE PLATFORM which contains 15 Columns and 720 Rows.From those colums and rows I have chosen Sentiments & platforms column for X-axis (Categorical variables) and Likes as rows for Y-axis (Continuous variables)and I have chosen BAR CHART (Horizontal bars)to visualize them in a clear and concise way.
